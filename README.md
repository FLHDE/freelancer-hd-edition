Freelancer: HD Edition is a mod that aims to improve every aspect of the game Freelancer (2003) while keeping the look and feel as close to vanilla as possible. It also serves as a customizable all-in-one package for players so they don't have to worry about installing countless patches and mods to create the perfect HD and bug-free install.

This mod was made possible thanks to the assistance of project Freelancer: Nomad Legacy. Huge thanks to the developers for allowing us to use their textures!

**N.B. Freelancer: HD Edition does not add additional content on top of Freelancer but rather enhances what the game already has to offer. Although minor gameplay changes were made, Freelancer: HD Edition will always be compatible with vanilla Freelancer. Therefore, players can use this mod to play on all vanilla servers as long as the server owners allow these changes.**
