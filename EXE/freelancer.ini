;;; ************************************************************************
;;; SNICHOLS:  There is a multi-player optimization that has been made to 
;;; the archetype system.  This optimization allows archetype-holding packets
;;; to store those values in 16 bits instead of 32 bits.  It is vital that
;;; the order of shared archetype initialization is kept in sync between
;;; the client and server.  This must be verified before releasing any patch
;;; without increasing the "build number".  Otherwise, unpredictable results
;;; will occur.
